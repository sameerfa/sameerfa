<h4 align="center"><samp> Hi there 👋🏾  welcome to my Github!

I'm Sameer, a full-stack engineer with experience building reliable software, scalable systems, and lately—AI-powered tools. 
I love clean code, well-architected systems, and making tech a little more human.

🎵 On the side, I'm making electronic <a href='https://open.spotify.com/artist/5Ne8fFIVoXnFwBwiO7fvGb?si=CTW9p7eUTqGKMxwOkMbtxQ'>music</a> and

🌍 I care about building things that make life easier for people.
